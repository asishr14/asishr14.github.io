#1.API
An application program interface ([API](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/API.html)) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact, like a gateway directing each request to its corresponding destination. There are many types of API and you can more details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (dont go here now, you may get overwhelmed and lost).

#2.Testing API
API testing is similar to testing any front-end application but without any pretty GUI. While testing any software aplication which is integrated with any API, testing API for that application will be part of Integration testing. 
Testing API during inital stages of application of SDLC and having it automated from then on makes the application more stable and can prevent the errors to reach client.
They are tons of tools to do all this [here](https://medium.com/@alicealdaine/top-10-api-testing-tools-rest-soap-services-5395cb03cfa9) are few with details. But, we will get started with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

#3.Requests
1.GET - As simple as "GET me food". A request for some specific data.--
2.POST - Consider it as user trying to send(POST) some data to the application. So API expects some sort of Body(data) in this request.--
3.PUT - Whatever you POSTed in the POST can be updated here in PUT. So API expects some sort of Body(of existing data) in this request.--
4.DELETE - As word says just "get rid of it". Here also API expects some sort of Body(of existing data) to get rid of.--

Thats all, you already mastered what happens in all of API.
